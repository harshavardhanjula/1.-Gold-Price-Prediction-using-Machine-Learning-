### **Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning**  

#### **📌 Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting gold prices using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing historical gold price data, we build predictive models to forecast future prices, helping investors and analysts make informed decisions.  

#### **📂 Project Structure**  
- **`gold price prediction using ML.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.  
- **`data/`** - Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.  
- **`models/`** - Saved trained models for future predictions.  
- **`README.md`** - Project documentation.  

#### **🔧 Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)  
- Scikit-Learn (ML Model Training)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

#### **📊 Features**  
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Machine Learning Model Training  
- Price Prediction & Evaluation  

#### **🚀 How to Run the Project**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gold-price-prediction.git
   cd gold-price-prediction
